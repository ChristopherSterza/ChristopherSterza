# About Me
Hi there! My name is Christopher Sterza and I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of California, Santa Cruz.

I'm learning more about software development each and every day, and I hope to be able to create some meaningful software in the near future.

This page is currently a work in progress, but right now:
# I'm currently learning
- Web Development
  - _React.js_
  - _Next.js_
  - _Node.js_
  - _Tailwind_
- Agile Practices
  - _SCRUM_
  - _Jira_

**ChristopherSterza/ChristopherSterza** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
